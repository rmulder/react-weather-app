# Weather Application

This weather application was created for Virtustream coding challenge. You can access the hosted website by clicking [here](http://stumbra.github.io/react-weather-app).

For further notice, I will try to fully switch to *Google Places API* for fetching countries, cities and etc., because using the *country-state-city* package feels redundant and increases the bundle size too much then I would like to. Also, I will might integrate [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to this project to increase the performance of the application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software:

1) You have to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine;
2) Install a package manager, [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) would be great choices.

*That should be enough, I will update prerequisites if something is missing.*

### Start-up

Now for running the project on your on machine:

1) Firstly, execute `npm i` or `yarn` in the command line to download all of the dependencies;
2) Secondly, just type `npm run start` or `yarn start` to launch the project and open a new browser tab.

You can now use the application in your browser. If you want to use your own API keys for [Google Maps](https://console.developers.google.com/) or [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) click on the links to see how to update them.
